Description: Performs the procedure proposed by Horiguchi et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/sim.7661>. The method specifies a set of truncation time points tau's for calculating restricted mean survival times (RMST), performs testing for equality, and estimates the difference in RMST between two groups at the specified tau's. Multiplicity by specifying several tau's is taken into account in this procedure.
